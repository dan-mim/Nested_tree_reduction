    This version of MAM adresses pb with very large but sparse support. In this case the distance matrix are computed one 
    by one (instead of building a huge distance matrix and only using the sparse rare columns)
    Input:
    *b: (resolution x n) vector collection of n probability distribution.
    *M_dist:( resolution x resolution) is the distance matrix between every supports.
    /!\ Note that M_dist can be a dictionary where M_dist[m] is the distance matrix between the support barycenter and the measure m.
    *exact: (bool) if True we use the free support method (large support considered, refer to Borckwardt), else fixed support, 
    meaning we keep the same support than have the b[i]s for the barycenter.
    *rho: (float) is an hyperparameter that is linked to the convergence speed but has no impact on the solution
    if rho is precised in the arguments of the function then this rho will be used
    * gamma: (float) value of the unbalanced parameter, if gamma=0, MAM treats the balanced barycenter problem
    * keep_track: (bool) should we keep records of the past barycenter approximations and other datas.
    * evry_it: (int) the datas are saved every evry_it iterations
    * name: (str) name of the saved data in the current repository
    * visualize: (bool) if True an approximation of the barycenter is displayed (usefull if image datas are treated)
    * computation_time: (float) maximal computation time in seconds
    * iterations_min: (int) minimal number of iterations
    * iterations_max: (int) maximal number of iterations
    * precision: (float) stopping criteria based on the fixed point method, using the norm max

    Output: p, P, Time, Wdist, l_precisionB, Precision, Iterations, total_time, iterations_k
    * p: (R x 1) the probability distribution of the calculated barycenter
    * P: (R x iterations_k) matrix that store 'p_' after eache iteration of the algorithm
    * Time: (1 x iterations_k) execution time of each iteration
    * Wdist: (1 x iterations_k) evolution of the approximated Wasserstein barycenter distance
    * l_precisionB: (1 x iterations_k) evolution of the evaluation of the accuracy of the approximated Wasserstein barycenter distance
    * Precision: (1 x iterations_k) evolution of the norm max stopping criterion 
    * Iterations: (1 x iterations_k) number of the saved iterations
    * total_time: (float) total computation time
    *iterations_k: (int) number of iterations 

    NB: it is possible to save the Pi's: the transport matrices between p and the probability densities
